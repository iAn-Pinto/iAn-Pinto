### Namaste Mitron üôè
My name is Ian Pinto and associate my first name iAn as a portmanteau formed from iOS and Android, the two high impact global mobile frontend development platforms on which I have been professionally managing projects since around the year 2009 at organizations like The Walt Disney Company, Tata Interactive Systems, and now my current organisation Kfintech.

I associate my name 'Pinto iAn' with my ongoing motto: Peer-into intelligence Augmentation nexus!

### I‚Äôm currently working as a Technical Project / Program / Product Manager (Managing tech team initiatives for fintech products) at Kfin Technologies Limited, Hyderabad, India.
My day to day responsibilities invole, managing front end (React, React Native, Android & iOS, SQLite) and backend (SQL, NodeJS, .net) tech teams for product development initiatives, for end to end digital transformation of mutual fund transactions through technical implementation and enhancement of Straight-Through Processing (STP) feature sets in various mobile and web app products used by Mutual Fund and NPS Investors, Mutual Dund Distributors and AMC RM's.


I use Stackoverflow and try to contribute back my insights on some questions developers raise there. I also blog on Medium and LinkedIn.
